			<h4>
				How do the Sifteo cubes work?
			</h4>
			<p>
				Sifteo cubes are an Intelligent Play Platform. Each cube is equipped with a full color display, a set of sensing technologies, and wireless communication. During gameplay, the cubes communicate with a nearby computer via the USB wireless link. Manage your games and buy new ones using the Sifteo application installed on your computer.
			</p>

			<h4>
				How do I play games?
			</h4>
			<p>
				Select a game from "My Games", and hit "Play." Your computer will connect to cubes within wireless range and begin playing the game.
			</p>

			<h4>
				How do I get new games?
			</h4>
			<p>
				You purchase Sifteo points, which you can then exchange for games and other content. Point packs and games are available in the Sifteo app store.
			</p>
			<p>
				Newly purchased games automatically download to your computer. The first time you play, the system will perform a one-time wireless installation onto your cubes. Then you're ready to go!
			</p>

			<h4>
				Do I need an account?
			</h4>
			<p>
				Yes, your account tracks which games you own, tracks how many points you have, and securely stores your payment information.
			</p>

			<h4>
				What's the battery life on a cube?
			</h4>
			<p>
				You can play Sifteo games for four hours or more solid without a recharge.
			</p>

			<h4>
				How do I turn a cube on or off?
			</h4>
			<p>
				Depress the clickable screen to turn a cube on. Cubes turn themselves off after a few minutes of inactivity.
			</p>

			<h4>
				What's the wireless range between the cubes and my computer?
			</h4>
			<p>
				You'll get the best performance nearby your computer, within a few feet of the USB wireless link. In good conditions the range can extend up to 20 feet.
			</p>

			<h4>
				How many cubes can I play with at once?
			</h4>
			<p>
				Our games work great with three cubes, but you can play with up to six at a time. You can get more cubes from the Sifteo website.
			</p>

			<h4>
				Can I combine my set with a friend's?
			</h4>
			<p>
				Yes - you can play with up to six cubes. Connect the cubes to a single computer, log in and play.
			</p>

			<h4>
				Can I use the cubes with more than one computer?
			</h4>
			<p>
				Sure - download Siftrunner onto as many computers as you like. Once you log in to Siftrunner, you'll have access to all your games, no matter which computer you are using.
			</p>

			<h4>
				What's the recommended age for Sifteo cubes?
			</h4>
			<p>
				We designed Sifteo cubes to be safely enjoyed by adults and kids 6 and older. We do not recommend use by very young children. The USB wireless link can present a choking hazard. The cubes, while sturdily designed, are sophisticated electronic devices. Very rough handling may damage or destroy them.
			</p>

			<h4>
				Do kids need supervision or help from an adult?
			</h4>
			<p>
				Parent involvement will undoubtedly vary according to the age, reading ability and comfort level of each child. We anticipate that younger children will need a bit more help from a parent to connect Sifteo cubes to the computer and download games. Playing the games should be fun and accessible to anyone aged 6 years and up.
			</p>

			<h4>
				 Can I use the Sifteo cubes with my Linux computer? How about my iPad?
			</h4>
			<p>
				At this time, Sifteo cubes are only compatible with Mac OS X 10.5+ and Windows XP and 7.
			</p>

			<h4>
				How sturdy is a cube? Is it waterproof?
			</h4>
			<p>
				We designed the cubes to withstand some physical abuse, and they are safe for kids six and older. They are not waterproof. While the cubes are sturdy, they are sophisticated electronic devices. Very rough handling (throwing, dousing in water, and other forms of cube torture) will probably break a cube permanently.
			</p>

			<h4>
				How do I clean my cubes?
			</h4>
			<p>
				Avoid cleaning your cubes with too much liquid. Squeeze as much liquid out of a slightly damp cloth as you can, and wipe down all sides, avoiding the top edges and without applying too much pressure to the screen. Let cubes dry, then wipe them again with a dry cloth.
			</p>
			
			<h4>
				When will the product be generally available?
			</h4>
			<p>
				We hope to make the product more widely available later in 2011.
			</p>

			<h4>
				Are you shipping outside the US?
			</h4>
			<p>
				Not at this time.
			</p>

			<h4>
				Is my billing information secure?
			</h4>
			<p>
				Yes. Our entire site uses 256-bit encryption for all data sent and received. Our payment provider is a validated Level 1 PCI DSS Compliant Service Provider, and is on Visa's Global Compliant Provider List and MasterCard's SDP List. Cardholder data is stored off-site using one of the most advanced encryption methods available.<br />

			</p>

			<h4>
				Why isn't my credit card being accepted?
			</h4>
			<p>
				Our payment system currently only accepts Visa and Mastercard, so double check your card type. Also make sure the billing address you entered matches the address where statements are sent. And of course, please feel to get in touch with use at <a href="mailto:help@sifteo.com">help@sifteo.com</a> any time, and we'll try to help.
